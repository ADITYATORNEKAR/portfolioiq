# High-Frequency Trading Platform: Causal Inference & Multi-Agent Architecture

This repository contains a sophisticated high-frequency trading (HFT) analytics platform that fuses causal discovery with multi-agent orchestration to isolate true price impact signals from retail sentiment in chaotic market conditions.

## Executive Strategy Overview

### The Problem

The modern financial ecosystem presents a paradox: while high-frequency market microstructure data is increasingly accessible, the influence of retail sentiment through social media creates chaotic volatility that blindsides traditional quantitative models. Price movements and social media mentions *appear* correlated but are often independently responding to latent macroeconomic confounders. Trading on these spurious correlations exposes portfolios to devastating drawdowns.

### The Solution

This platform constructs a **Unified Model and Agentic Development Lifecycle** that:

1. **Ingests live tick-by-tick data** from Finnhub and Alpha Vantage alongside Reddit sentiment streams
2. **Applies rigorous causal filtering** via PC algorithm and Double Machine Learning to validate true sentiment causality
3. **Orchestrates autonomous agents** using LangGraph to formulate mathematically validated trading intelligence
4. **Simulates user portfolios** under real market friction (slippage, transaction costs, partial fills)
5. **Deploys on free-tier infrastructure** (Vercel + Render) to demonstrate production-grade capabilities without capital outlay

## Architecture Overview

### Data Ingestion Strategy

The platform manages high-velocity data streams within economic constraints of free-tier APIs:

| API Provider | Data Category | Free Tier Capacity | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Finnhub** | Tick-by-tick prices, sentiment | 60 req/min | WebSocket streaming to minimize REST overhead |
| **Alpha Vantage** | Technical indicators (RSI, EMA) | 5 req/min | Token-bucket regulator with 0.42s delays |
| **Reddit API** | r/wallstreetbets, r/investing | OAuth2 Streaming | Async batching into 10-second windows |
| **Alpaca Markets** | Live trades, order book | Free with account | Direct integration for paper trading |

### Statistical Foundation

#### Stationarity Testing (ADF Test)
The platform continuously validates time series stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test before feeding data into ARIMA and causal algorithms. Non-stationary price series are integrated until stationarity requirements are met.

#### Intelligent Sentiment Analysis (FinBERT)
Raw Reddit text is processed through **FinBERT**, a BERT model fine-tuned on 4.9 billion financial tokens including 10-K filings, earnings calls, and analyst reports. This captures domain-specific financial sentiment that general-purpose models miss entirely (e.g., "diamond hands" → bullish signal).

#### Market Regime Classification (GMM)
A Gaussian Mixture Model clusters market microstructure variables (VIX, volume, bid-ask spread) into three regimes:
- **Risk-On**: Elevated risk appetite, trend-following strategies profitable
- **High-Volatility**: Breakout conditions, mean reversion futile
- **Mean-Reverting**: Range-bound, statistical arbitrage viable

#### Baseline Trajectory (ARIMA)
An ARIMA(p,d,q) model maintains a technical baseline, forecasting price movements based purely on historical patterns. Actual prices are compared against ARIMA forecasts to identify "surprises"—deviations potentially causally linked to sentiment shifts.

### Causal Discovery & Impact Quantification

#### PC Algorithm for DAG Discovery
The `causal-learn` library implements the PC algorithm to discover the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing true causal structure among market variables. This eliminates spurious correlations by identifying conditional independence relationships.

#### Double Machine Learning (DML) for Treatment Effects
Once a causal path from sentiment to price is identified, **EconML** performs Double Machine Learning to estimate **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** while controlling for high-dimensional confounders:

1. Model confounders (X) → outcome (Y) and extract residuals
2. Model confounders (X) → treatment (T) and extract residuals  
3. Estimate causal effect: τ = Cov(residual_T, residual_Y) / Var(residual_T)

This ensures sentiment's impact on the user's portfolio is statistically sound and isolated from broader market movements.

### Multi-Agent System Architecture

The platform is decomposed into specialized agents collaborating through LangGraph stateful workflows:

| Agent | Role | Inputs | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Analyst Agent** | Evaluates price trends, sentiment, regime clusters | ARIMA, GMM, FinBERT scores | Signal generation |
| **Risk Manager Agent** | Validates causal significance, computes exposures | EconML ATE results, concentration, volatility | Safety guardrails |
| **Backtester Agent** | Simulates trades for user portfolios | User tickers, OHLCV history, slippage models | Theoretical execution |
| **Execution Agent** | Translates validated weights to orders or fills | Validated signals, capital limits, slippage | Order formulation |

#### Decision-Making Workflow

1. **Portfolio Input**: User provides target universe of stocks via dashboard
2. **Ingestion & Analysis**: Analyst Agent monitors live price series + sentiment stream
3. **Simulation & Validation**: Backtester Agent runs theoretical execution against user portfolio
4. **Causal Validation**: Risk Manager validates signal's causal ATE
5. **Execution Formulation**: Execution Agent formulates trading rules for paper trading or reporting

### Simulation Engine

#### Backtesting Paradigms

**Vectorized Backtesting**: Entire price series processed in batches via vectorbt's NumPy operations. Test thousands of parameter combinations in seconds.

**Event-Based Simulation**: Discrete market event loop with realistic market frictions:
- **Slippage**: Expected vs actual execution price
- **Transaction Costs**: Commission and fee models
- **Partial Fills**: Order book depth simulation

#### Performance Metrics

Specialized Performance Metric Agent evaluates results:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return efficiency
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk protection (critical for HFT)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough decline measurement
- **Causal ATE**: Specific impact of sentiment spikes on portfolio stocks, isolated from noise

## Development Lifecycle (MDLC + ADLC)

The platform integrates traditional Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MDLC) with the Agentic Development Life Cycle (ADLC):

| Phase | Focus | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **Preparation & Hypotheses** | Market inefficiencies, sentiment patterns discovery | Documented Sentiment Causality Hypothesis |
| **Scope Framing** | Agentic autonomy boundaries, risk tolerance | Human–Agent Responsibility Model |
| **Data Engineering** | Real-time tick and social data pipelines | Validated Multi-Source Data Stream |
| **Model Engineering** | FinBERT, GMM, ARIMA baselines training | Validated Sentiment & Regime Models |
| **Simulation & Validation** | Backtesting against historical data | Causal Backtest Report (Sharpe/Sortino) |
| **Causal Validation** | PC algorithm + DML impact estimation | Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) |
| **Agent Implementation** | LangGraph orchestration + tools | Compiled Multi-Agent Trading Graph |
| **Simulation & Deployment** | Backtesting + phased Vercel/Render release | Live Agentic Dashboard |

---

## Operational Governance

The system implements **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** checkpoints:
- If simulation detects high expected slippage, system pauses for human review
- If Risk Manager identifies concentration limit breach, trading rules are escalated
- Ensures agentic portfolio advisor remains a transparent tool for quantitative research
